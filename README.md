# Dynamic-Canary-Pin
This program is an attempt to use a DBI framework called Pin to detect attacks against the stack. It is based on the idea of a current
protection mechanism called "Canary". The differece is that the Canary is implemented at compile time while this tool is implemented 
dynamically in execution time.
